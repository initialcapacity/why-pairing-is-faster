    \begin{abstract}
        We have long discussed how pair programming, among several benefits, accelerates knowledge sharing, ensures
        collective code ownership, and increases overall developer productivity~\cite{fowler:pairing}.
        These benefits outweigh the previously assumed decrease in velocity and high cost due to having two people do
        the work of one.
        Recently, we have been able to show that pairing does not negatively impact velocity.
        On the contrary, pairing can improve velocity significantly, even in the short term.
        We complete more features faster by pairing because the code reviews happen in real time rather than
        asynchronously.

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

    Learning any new product domain or language takes time.
    Collaborating with individuals that have a solid understanding of product domain and programming language can be
    highly beneficial for newcomers to a product.
    Pair programming, or having the two developers work side-by-side on a common problem or set of features, is one form
    of this collaboration.

    However, once developers have a solid understanding of product domain and technology stack, the question quickly
    becomes: What happens when individuals understand both product domain and technology?
    Should they still pair?

    The simple answer might be yes, because both domain and technology are constantly changing and there is always more
    to learn.
    In addition, the benefits of collective ownership alone might lead individuals to continuing to pair.

    \begin{displayquote}[\cite{fowler:pairing}][\textit{Birgitta BÃ¶ckeler and Nina Siessegger}]
        ``[Pairing] increases the chances that anyone on the team feels comfortable changing the code almost anywhere."
    \end{displayquote}

    We have recently discovered that the impact of continuing to pair is most influenced by how easy the work is to
    parallelize.


    \section{Workflows}\label{sec:workflows}

    We begin with a series of fundamental definitions to help us define the pairing and pull request workflows.

    \subsection{User Stories}\label{subsec:user-stories}

    \begin{definition}
        A \textit{user story} is an independently-deployable unit of work that delivers business value.
    \end{definition}

    User stories are the smallest unit of work tracked by software teams.
    By keeping user stories small, teams ensure that business owners have full visibility and control over the order
    in which stories are delivered.
    This ensures that teams are always working on the most important features.

    \begin{definition}
        A \textit{well-functioning team} splits their work into the smallest user stories as possible in order to stay
        flexible and deliver incremental value.
        The code for each user story should be able to be completed within four to eight hours.
    \end{definition}

    In order to track the size of user stories, well-functioning teams estimate story size.

    \begin{definition}
        The \textit{point estimate} of a user story represents the well-functioning team's judgment of the story's
        complexity.
    \end{definition}

    While point estimates are not tied directly to time, the number of points that a well-functioning team can complete
    in a week is relatively constant.
    For the sake of simplicity we'll refer to $n$-hour stories (which take developers $n$ hours to code), assuming that
    the time/complexity correlation has been calculated.

    It is important to call out that a user story is not finished until other developers can build off its results and
    it is deployed to a production-like environment.
    This occurs when the code is merged into the mainline branch.

    \begin{definition}
        A user story is \textit{finished} once the code is merged into the mainline branch.
    \end{definition}

    \subsection{Pair Programming}\label{subsec:pairing}

    Pair programming is style of work where two developer work together on a user story while controlling the same machine.
    Code review happens in real time during pair programming;
    as one developer authors the code the other constantly evaluates design decisions and watches for errors.
    This short feedback loop allows for high quality code and rapid knowledge transfer.

    \begin{definition}
        The \textit{pairing workflow} consists of developers working in pairs, conducting live code review, and
        committing to the mainline branch once the code is complete.
    \end{definition}

    As code review happens in real time, the code written for a story is ready to merge into the mainline as soon as it
    is complete.

    \begin{lemma}
        \label{lemma:pair}
        Two developers working in the pairing workflow will finish an $n$-hour story in $n$ hours.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        Each $n$-hour story takes $n$ hours to code.
        Since code review is completed live while pairing, the code is merged into the mainline branch in $n$ hours.
    \end{proof}

    \subsection{Pull Requests}\label{subsec:pull-requests}

    In a pull request workflow, developers work individually, completing the code for a given user story before a formal
    code review.
    Once the code is complete, it must be approved by another developer on the team before it can be merged into the
    mainline branch.

    \begin{definition}
        In the \textit{pull request workflow} each developer works individually and submits the code for each user story
        asynchronous review by others through pull requests.
        Another developer reviews thoroughly reviews the pull request and suggests changes.
        The author reviews these changes, updates the pull request, and merges the code into the mainline branch.
    \end{definition}

    Other developers on the team are often busy with other tasks, so there is often a delay before the code is reviewed.

    \begin{lemma}
        \label{lemma:solo}
        A developer working in the pull request workflow will complete an $n$-hour story in $2n$ hours.
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        In order to complete a thorough code review, the reviewer spend at least $\frac{n}{4}$ hours reviewing the pull
        request, and the author must the same amount of time reviewing the changes and applying updates.
        To allow for the asynchronous nature of the pull request workflow, we must allow for at least $\frac{n}{2}$
        hours in waiting and communication time.
    \end{proof}


    \section{Parallelization}\label{sec:parallelization}

    We next examine the shape of a team's work, or how developers complete a series of user stories over time.

    \begin{definition}
        A \textit{backlog} is an ordered collection of user stories.
    \end{definition}

    A backlog is an ordered collection of stories.
    In any non-trivial project there are dependencies between stories that prevent one story from being started until
    another story has been completed.

    \begin{definition}
        A user story $\alpha_1$ \textit{depends on} a user story $\alpha_2$ if developers must wait to start work on
        $\alpha_1$ until $\alpha_2$ is finished.
    \end{definition}

    The pace at which a team moves through a backlog is directly tied to the amount of business value that the team
    delivers.
    Teams strive to deliver value at the fastest pace that is sustainable over an extended period of time.

    \begin{definition}
        A team's \textit{velocity} is the speed at which it delivers user value.
        We measure velocity as the rate at which the teams finishes stories, where each story is weighted by its
        estimate.
        If, in a given day, a team completes stories $\{\alpha_1, \alpha_2,\dots,\alpha_k\}$ with estimates
        $\{n_1, n_2,\dots,n_k\}$ then the team's daily velocity is $\sum_1^k n_k$.
    \end{definition}

    In a team of multiple developers, velocity is maximized if all developers are able to stay busy with story work.
    This is easier said than done.
    Teams must minimize the cases where the complex web of dependencies between stories in a backlog block some
    developers from story work.

    \begin{definition}
        A backlog is \textit{parallelizable} into $n$ workstreams (at a given point in time) if there are $n$ stories
        able to be started, reviewed, or revised.
    \end{definition}

    In the fortunate case that stories are highly parallelizable, teams move quickly regardless of their working model.

    \begin{lemma}
        \label{lemma:parallel}
        A team of $2n$ developers with a backlog with more than $2n$ workstreams has an average daily velocity of $4n$,
        regardless of working model (assuming an 8-hour day).
    \end{lemma}
    \begin{proof}
        By Lemma~\ref{lemma:pair} each pair will complete $8n$ worth of stories in an 8-hour day and by
        Lemma~\ref{lemma:solo} each developer will complete $4n$ worth of stories in an 8-hour day, giving each team an
        average daily velocity of $4n$.
    \end{proof}

    The power of pairing is the ability for a team to work quickly on a backlog, even when parallelization is limited.

    \begin{theorem}
        A well-functioning team of developers working as pairs is as fast or faster than a team of developers using pull
        requests.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Suppose a team of $2n$ developers has a backlog that is parallelizable into $m > 0$ workstreams.
        We will examine three different cases for the size $m$, and show that the team's velocity working in pairs is at
        least as fast as the team's velocity using pull requests.

        Suppose that $m\geq 2n$.
        Then by Lemma~\ref{lemma:parallel} the team achieves an equal velocity regardless of working model.

        Next, suppose that $n\leq m < 2n$.
        In a team working in a pairing model, each of the $n$ pairs are able to work unrestricted, so the team has a
        daily velocity of $4n$.
        In a team working with pull requests, only $m$ developers are busy at any point in time, so the team has a daily
        velocity of $2m$.
        Using the original assumption that $m < 2n$ we see that $2m < 4n$, so the team working in the pairing model is
        faster.

        Finally, suppose that $0 < m < n$
        In a team working in a pairing model, $m$ pairs are able to work unrestricted, thus the team has a daily
        velocity of $4m$.
        In a team working with pull requests, only $m$ developers are busy at any point in time, so the team has a daily
        velocity of $2m$.
        As before, the team working in a pairing model is faster.
    \end{proof}


    \section{Summary}\label{sec:summary}

    When paring, dependencies between stories in a backlog have less of an impact on team velocity.
    The impact of dependencies is much higher in a pull request workflow, meaning stories must be highly parallelizable
    to achieve the same productivity.
